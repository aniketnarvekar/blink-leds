#+TITLE: Blink-leds

It's a beginner's project to learn to create and write code for the STM32F3DISCOVERY board.

Warning: I had problems building a project at the start when I added the STM32F3-DISCOVERY crate. It
was solved by adding the following lines:

#+begin_src rust
  #[allow(unused_imports)]
  use stm32f3_discovery::stm32f3xx_hal::interrupt;
#+end_src

After completing the project, I removed the above lines and cleaned and built the project, and it
was built successfully. I'm not sure what happened.
